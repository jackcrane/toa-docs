# Getting Started with the TOA API
{: .no_toc }

The Orange Alliance provides a powerful API that allows us to easily access their data.

Unfortunately, TOA's documentation is not specific and vague, so this is an *unaffiliated* documentation source

We also recommend you check out the official API documentation over on [TOA's API Docs webpage](https://theorangealliance.org/apidocs)
